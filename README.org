#+TITLE: agda-brainfuck

The beginnings of a brainfuck compiler written in agda which may eventually have some interesting features. Firstly, I want to work out how to prove properties of the programs. Here are some easy examples:
- Prove that nops can be removed
- Prove when loops don't terminate
- Prove empty loops can be removed
- Prove loops that are skipped can be removed
